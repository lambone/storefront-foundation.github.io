# Getting Started

To create a new React Storefront app, ensure node 10 or newer is installed and run:

```
npm create react-storefront --yes (my-app-name)
```

Once your app has been created, you can start it in development mode by running:

```
cd (my-app-name)
npm run dev
```

The starter app has four types of pages:

- Homepage
- Category
- Product
- Cart
